# Problem Statement
The problem started when I used an online "image merge" platform. The first three image upload was for free, but then, it charged me to pay 20 cents per image. From this problem, I decided to create my own image merging program that is not commercially used. None of advertisement is included in this program. With a click of download, you can easily merge infinite number of images.
